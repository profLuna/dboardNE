This page provides links to download PDF reports describing the findings and methodologies used to to identify the geographic and demographic characteristics of communities across New England that are:

1. overburdened by current transportation-related emissions and related externalities; 
2. at increased risk for heat island effects, which is exacerbated by climate change and transportation related air pollution;
3. likely to experience evacuation risks and other transportation-related vulnerabilities resulting from flooding, extreme weather, and other climate stressors, and
4. underserved by current public transit infrastructure or services and overburdened by transportation related costs.
